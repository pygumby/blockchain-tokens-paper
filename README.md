# blockchain-tokens-paper

This repository holds my paper on blockchain tokens.
It was originally written as a seminar paper as part of my master's studies at Wilhelm BÃ¼chner Hochschule.

You can read

* my working copy in [Markdown](blockchain-tokens-paper.md) format (GitHub renders this nicely) or
* the version I submitted to university in [Microsoft Word](blockchain-tokens-paper.docx) or [PDF](blockchain-tokens-paper.pdf) format.
